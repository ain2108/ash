cash
cash is a very simple shell that supports pipes and three builtin commands:
cd, history and exit. Builtin commands do not work with pipelines, as specified
in the spec. 

A line is read from stdin. This is handled by a function get_big_line().
The function will initially malloc a buffer of size COMMON_SIZE. Afer that,
if line is bigger then COMMON_SIZE, the function will realloc() to COMMON_SIZE * 2.

The read line is then passed to function execute_line(). Execute line will save the input
line into history[HISTORY_SIZE], make minor formattig changes to the line, use strtok() to
tokenize the line and finally build a stack allocated array of strings, where each string can
be either a cmd, an argument to the command or a pipe "|". execute_line() will call inerpret()
on the array of strings. 

interpret() will make decisions on what to do with the array of strings. It will recognize if the array represents 
a single executable, a built in function or a pipeline of executables. If the array represents a pipeline, interpret() will
find the positions of pipes, check for correct semantics, isolate parts of the input array of string into an array of lines
where each line is a single executable with its arguments. After that, it will create two pipe1 and pipe2, loop throuh the array of
individual executables callin execute_line() on each of them. To avoid duplication of history, flag PIPELINE=1 which will 
influence the behaviour of execute_line() appropriately. During the iteration, pipes will be swapped and recycled appropriately.
If the input array of strings is a single executable command with its arguments, interpret() will call execute(). Finally, if the 
input array of strings is a built in command, interpret will perform actions appropriate to the built in. 

execute() has awareness of who and under what cicumstances has called it through consultin a set of global variables. 
In short, execute forks(), parent returns immediately, child sets up the I/O appropriately to the state of the program, and
executes the executable. If error occurs, child cleans up and exits with an error message printed to stderr. 

Child processes are all waited for by their main parrent. In the end of interpret one can see this routine.
History is implemented using an array and modular arithmeti, and some more hacked up arithmetic. But it works. 
Each error is assigned an integer value. The function handle_error(int ERROR_CODE) will, you guessed it, handle errors. 
As of now, for most of the errors, error handle = careful termination of the program. 
I think this should cover it more or less.

ash should run valgrind clean.
If run on MAC, there will be 10k bytes displayed as still reachable on exit.
At the top of shell.c there is a flag ON_MAC, that if set to 1 will 
This problem does not exist on Debian.

Build the shell by simply running make in the root directory. 
Notice, the test run is done on OS X, therefore paths are slightly 
different.

myhmw1-tests.py contains the standard tests plus few more that I have added.
I ran out of time, so my set of tests is far from impressive. 
The tester completes all the tests succesfully on Debian:
w4118@w4118:~/OS/tester-hmwk1$ python myhmw1-tests.py 
2 of 2 tests passed
5 of 5 tests passed
12 of 12 tests passed
